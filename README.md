# Hello-World

Hello there, I'm Mikie Benedetto and I am currently studying CIS at the University of Louisville.  I have completed one internship at LG&E (Louisville Gas & Electric) working on the IT.Net Mobile team developing a web application to help make their pay more efficient.  I had to write my code in JavaScript C# and SQL.

I am currently interning at ARC (Airlines Reporting Corporation) working on their Security Information Operations team, working with the blue and red team. For this internship I have been looking over Python and using Metaspolit.

Both internships were with great companies.
